# unittest-framework

This repo holds a demonstration example of a development using a unittest frame work

The recommended directory structure is to separate the test code from development and release code under two different directories
    connectorProject                # development directory
    connectorUnittest               # test cases directory

Other helper files and directories:
    datasets                        # directory to hold data used in the demo code
    requirement.txt                 # pip requirements file
    setupPyPath.sh                  # bash file to be sources to setup PYTHONPATH env
