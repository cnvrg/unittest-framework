# unittest-framework:

This repo holds a demonstration example of a development using a unittest frame work

## Recommended directory structure :
The recommended directory structure is to separate the test code from development and release code under two different directories
>1. connectorProject                 # development directory
>2. connectorUnittest                # test cases directory

##  Other helper directories and files :
    datasets                        # directory to hold data used in the demo code
    requirement.txt                 # pip requirements file
    setupPyPath.sh                  # bash file to be sources to setup PYTHONPATH env
