# unittest-framework

This repo demonstrate an exaple of the project development with unittest frame work

The recommended directory structure is to separate the test code from development and release code under two different directories
    connectorProject                # development directory
    connectorUnittest               # test cases directory

Other helper files and directories:
    datasets                        # directory to hold data used in the demo code
    requirement.txt                 # pip requirements file
    setupPyPath.sh                  # bash file to be sources to setup PYTHONPATH env
